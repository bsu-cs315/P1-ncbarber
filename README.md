## Reflection

This iteration of the project was definetly a bit more intimidating at first glance. I thought there were things that I might have been done in the last iteratoin that would make it very difficult to get through this iteration. One of those key things was getting things like the Aliens that I have and the stars. I didn't know exactly how to go about making those items that sort of just spawned in. With some look at previous works, and looking at a reset button, it sparked an idea of how to load those scenes of the alien and ball. After getting to a point where I could get these to spawn and despawn everything felt good. The HUD help that we got in class really made things regarding that a lot easier. Other than that I ran into a few issues with sound files. I found that trying to use a small OGG file made it loop even when set to not do so. After I started using WAV files that issue was not present. Its something that I'll have to still see why that is but I was able to work around it.

- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [X] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [X] C-6: The projectile and targets are shown with 2D graphics.
- [X] C-7: The game plays an appropriate sound effect when the projectile is fired.
- [X] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.

- [X] A-1: Earn three stars.
- [X] ⭐ The player has a small inventory of projectiles, and only one can be launched at a time.
- [X] ⭐ The background and ground use 2D graphics.
- [X] ⭐ A <abbr title="Heads-Up Display">HUD</abbr> shows the current game state such as the score and number of projectiles remaining.

When looking through this list for an evaluation I can see that I did everything that I wanted.
All of the things that I did were needed to get an A.
Since I was able to get all of the stars, I feel confident saything this is an A level project.
