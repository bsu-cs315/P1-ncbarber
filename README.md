## Reflection

Through this iteration I found many things that were really fun small challenges. I liked trying to make a different basic animations for the title screen to add a little bit of pop to the project. I think that my only major issue that I had in this iteration was ust getting the animatoins to work exactly how I wanted them to. There weren't any sort of problems that I was not able to solve with a little bit of effort. I think that the only that that I would have changed about this project was making some more animations through the normal gameplay. On top of this adding some variability in how the starts spawn instead of having them in a set spot. These were the only things that I thought would make the game more interesting, but I would have only been able to do them if there was a lot more time that we speant on this project. This project has given me the confidence going forward that I can get many of the parts of a basic game done, and I am looking forward to putting that confidence into other projects.

When looking through this list for an evaluation I can see that I did everything that I wanted tp do in the final iteration.
All of the things that I did were needed to get an A.
Since I was able to get all of the stars, I feel confident saything this is an A level project.
